//ðŸ”¸ Question 2: Vehicle Movement â€“ Dynamic Behavior Based on Vehicle Type
//
//Description:
//Create a base class Vehicle with a method move(). Create 3 subclasses: Car, Bike, and Bus. Each subclass should override the move() method with its own behavior.
//
//Task:
//
//Write a function startJourney(Vehicle v) that accepts any vehicle object and calls its move() method.
//
//Objective:
//Show dynamic method dispatch where the decision of which move() method to call happens at runtime
